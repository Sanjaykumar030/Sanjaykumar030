### 🧪 Projects

Here are a few projects I’ve built:

- ⚙️ **[Differential Equation Solver](https://github.com/Sanjaykumar030/DiffEqnSolver)**  
  Solves linear differential equations up to 6th order. Handles auxiliary equations, roots (real, complex, and repeated), and computes complementary functions. Built with Python (SymPy + Tkinter GUI).

- 📊 **[Fermi-Dirac Probability Visualizer](https://github.com/Sanjaykumar030/Fermi-Dirac-Probability-Visualizer)**  
  An interactive Python tool that visualizes Fermi-Dirac distribution in semiconductors. It plots occupation probability vs energy levels based on temperature and band structure. Developed using Matplotlib, NumPy, and Jupyter Notebook.

- 🏠 **[Chennai Housing Price Predictor](https://github.com/Sanjaykumar030/Chennai-Housing-Model)**  
  Machine learning project using XGBoost to predict real estate prices in Chennai based on features like size, amenities, and locality. Achieved 0.99 R² score on test data.
